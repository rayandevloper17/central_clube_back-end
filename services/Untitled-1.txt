IN : PS E:\backend\backend> 

we have w new senrio we need to build is the : mmbership of the user 
we have 5 mmbership type : 
0 - normal 
1 - accese 
2 - Gold 
3 - platinum 
4 - infinity 
 

So  firs e need add the modul of it in moduls in the backend project ..
this is it 

name : membership 
 - id  : bigint : primiery key 
 - id_user  bigint 
 - id_club  bigint 
 - dateend date
 - typemmbership bigint   :
 
and then u will go to creat the controller and the services and the routing and the midliwear of it .. 
 - So the logic of the mmbership working like this : 
 -  the type 0 : normal is : 
                 - in the plage hourair pric of the reservation u will display it normlly as u get it from the db 
                 - the user can't open match ouvert ( make it diable in reservation page ) but can opoen match prv . 
                 - the user can will see just ( 15 days in the date piker list in the reservation page ) 
                 - the user can cancel reservation 48h before the match start  
                 - can join in prv match and ouvert also ( but can creat it ( ouvert match)) 


- the type 1  : access is : 
                - in the plage hourair pric of the reservation u will display it normlly as u get it from the db 
                - the user can open match ouvert and prv . 
                - the user can will see just ( 19 days in the date piker list in the reservation page ) 
                - the user can cancel reservation 24h before the match start  
                - can join in prv match and ouvert also
- the type 2  : gold is : 
                -every balance make it calculate -300 ( means if the creino from the db is 1000 so the system when he reserve will take a  700  from the balance )
                - in the plage hourair pric of the reservation u will display it normlly as u get it from the db 
                - the user can open match ouvert and prv . 
                - the user can will see just ( 21 days in the date piker list in the reservation page ) 
                - the user can cancel reservation 24h before the match start  
                - can join in prv match and ouvert also ( all)

                - can join in prv match and ouvert also

- the type 3  : platinum is : 
                -every balance make it calculate -300 ( means if the creino from the db is 1000 so the system when he reserve will take a  700  from the balance )
                - in the plage hourair pric of the reservation u will display it normlly as u get it from the db 
                - the user can open match ouvert and prv . 
                - the user can will see just ( 28 days in the date piker list in the reservation page ) 
                - the user can cancel reservation 12h before the match start  
                - can join in prv match and ouvert also ( all)


- the type 4  :  infinity is : 
                -Here when the user is infinity wil lnever pay for the reservesion u will appear it like its for free ..
                - in the plage hourair pric of the reservation u will display it normlly as u get it from the db 
                - the user can open match ouvert and prv . 
                - the user can will see just ( 28 days in the date piker list in the reservation page ) 
                - the user can cancel reservation 24h before the match start  
                - can join in prv match and ouvert also ( all)




So this is the condition that u woill buuld the cointrollers afor it 
and u will edit the reservation page to make it work with the membership  

and in the modul as u see there is : dateend always in every action u will verfy this 
" dateend " ifit;s over u will stopt that offre for him and make it is normall user and apply the condition of it for him 


also apply all those chnages in the frontend side ( controller getx etc .. and the ui of it ) 
and int the profile of the user show the type of the membership by the color them of it
